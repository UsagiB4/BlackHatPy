socket programming is one of the most fundamental skill to be a hacker. You will need to communicate with the server and get the responses.
Below is a common code that get response back from google.com
```python
# simple tcp client with python

import socket

target_host = 'www.google.com'
target_port = 80

# socket object
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  
# connec the client
client.connect((target_host, target_port))

# seding data
client.send(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: google.com\r\n\r\n")

# recieve data
response = client.recv(4096)

print(response.decode())
client.close()
```
